Changelog
=========

Version 0.0.2.0
---------------

<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.0.2.0>

*   Added optimized numeric `Op`s, and re-write `Num`/`Fractional`/`Floating`
    instances in terms of them.

*   Removed all traces of `Summer`/`Unity` from the library, eliminating a
    whole swath of "explicit-Summer"/"explicit-Unity" versions of functions.
    As a consequence, the library now only works with `Num` instances.  The
    API, however, is now much more simple.

*   Benchmark suite added for MNIST example.

Version 0.0.1.0
---------------

<https://github.com/mstksg/backprop/releases/tag/v0.0.1.0>

*   Initial pre-release, as a request for comments.  API is in a usable form
    and everything is fully documented, but there are definitely some things
    left to be done. (See [README.md][readme-0.0.1.0])
